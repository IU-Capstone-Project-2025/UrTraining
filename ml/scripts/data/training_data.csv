We’ll blend traditional CrossFit movements with targeted stretching and mobility work.  The focus isn\'t on max effort strength, but on controlled movements and increasing range of motion.  Consistency is key. Listen to your body, modify exercises as needed, and prioritize proper form over speed or weight. Remember, flexibility is a journey, not a destination.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially before, during, and after workouts. Consider adding electrolytes if you sweat heavily.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.  A post-workout protein shake (20-30g) can aid recovery.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Magnesium glycinate can aid muscle recovery and relaxation. Omega-3 fatty acids can reduce inflammation. Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night.  Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged. Foam rolling and self-massage are excellent tools for muscle recovery.\n* **Scaling:** If an exercise feels too difficult, scale it down. Reduce weight, reps, or range of motion.  Never sacrifice form.\n* **Warm-up & Cool-down:** *Never* skip these! They are crucial for injury prevention and recovery.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Assessment**\n\n**Day 1: Mobility & Core Activation (25 mins)**\n\n* **Warm-up (5 mins):**  Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) 2 mins.

I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","113    {'Activity Type': 'HIIT', 'Program Goal': ['Mu...

This program is designed for beginners with little to no prior weightlifting experience. We'll focus on proper form, progressive overload, and consistent stretching to achieve both muscle growth and increased range of motion.\n\n**Trainer:** Maria Kuznetsova, NASM Certified Personal Trainer (Basic)\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when you need to. Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.  YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","42    {'Activity Type': 'Bodybuilding', 'Program Goa...

This program is designed for beginners with little to no prior weightlifting experience. We'll focus on proper form, progressive overload, and consistent stretching to achieve both muscle growth and increased range of motion.\n\n**Trainer:** Maria Kuznetsova, NASM Certified Personal Trainer (Basic)\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when you need to. Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.  YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","84    {'Activity Type': 'HIIT', 'Program Goal': ['Mu...

Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","3    {'Activity Type': 'HIIT', 'Program Goal': ['Mu...

This program is designed for beginners, focusing on building a solid foundation while maximizing muscle stimulation through High-Intensity Interval Training. Remember consistency is key! Listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and don't be afraid to modify exercises as needed.  We’ll focus on compound movements to get the most ‘bang for your buck’ and stimulate multiple muscle groups simultaneously.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, and increase intake on workout days.  Consider an electrolyte drink post-workout, especially if you sweat heavily.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires adequate protein intake. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.  Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Supplements (Optional):**  Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid muscle growth and performance.  Whey protein can help meet protein goals. *Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:**  Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night.  Active recovery (light cardio, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form Over Everything:** Watch videos of each exercise before attempting it.

It prioritizes controlled movements, high reps, and active recovery.  The duration is kept to 30 minutes or less to minimize stress on the body while maximizing effectiveness.  Listen to your body, and *always* prioritize form over weight.  This is about rebuilding and becoming stronger, not ego lifting.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Medical Clearance:** *Crucially*, this program assumes you have been cleared by a doctor or physical therapist to engage in bodybuilding and endurance-focused exercises, especially considering the rehabilitation aspect.\n* **Nutrition:**  This program is *most* effective when paired with a diet rich in protein (1.6-2.2g/kg bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.  Hydration is paramount – aim for at least 3 liters of water daily. Consider supplementing with creatine monohydrate (3-5g/day) for enhanced endurance and recovery, and a multivitamin. Consult with a registered dietitian for personalized nutrition guidance.\n* **Form:** Watch videos of each exercise to ensure proper form. Incorrect form can negate benefits and increase injury risk.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase weight, reps, or sets each week, *only* if your form remains impeccable.\n* **Rest & Recovery:**  Adequate sleep (7-9 hours) is non-negotiable.  Active recovery days are vital.  Don't skip them!\n* **Listen to Your Body:**  If you experience pain, STOP. Modify the exercise or consult with a professional.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Activation (Focus: Re-establishing Neuromuscular Connection)**\n\n* **Frequency:** 5 days/week\n* **Intensity:** Low-Moderate\n\n**Day 1: Upper Body - Push**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio (light jogging/jumping jacks), dynamic stretching (arm circles, shoulder rotations).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Incline Dumbbell Press: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Push-ups (modified on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP), 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Shoulder Press: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Triceps Pushdowns (cable or band): 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (chest, shoulders, triceps) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements. Hydrate well.\n\n**Day 2: Lower Body - Quad Focus**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio (light cycling), dynamic stretching (leg swings, hip circles).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Bodyweight Squats: 3 sets of 20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Walking Lunges: 3 sets of 10 reps per leg, 60 sec rest\n    * Leg Extensions (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 45 sec rest\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (quads, hamstrings, calves) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n* **Note:** Maintain proper squat form – chest up, back straight.\n\n**Day 3: Active Recovery**\n* 30 minutes of low-intensity cardio (walking, swimming, cycling).  Focus on blood flow and gentle movement.\n* Foam rolling for major muscle groups.\n\n**Day 4: Upper Body - Pull**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio, dynamic stretching (arm circles, torso twists).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Lat Pulldowns (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 15-20 reps per arm, 60 sec rest\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n    * Bicep Curls (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (back, biceps) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n\n**Day 5: Core & Full Body**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio, dynamic stretching.\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds\n    * Russian Twists: 3 sets of 20 reps\n    * Bird Dog: 3 sets of 10 reps per side\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (core, glutes) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n\n---\n\n**Week 2-10: Progressive Overload & Endurance Building**\n\n*(The following is a summary. Each week will follow a similar structure to Week 1, but with progressive adjustments. I will outline key changes for each week, rather than repeating the full daily schedule.)*\n\n**Weeks 2-4: Increasing Volume**\n* **Key Changes:** Increase reps by 2-5 per set.  Introduce supersets (performing two exercises back-to-back with no rest). Reduce rest intervals to 45-60 seconds.  Introduce variations of exercises (e.g., incline dumbbell press to flat dumbbell press).\n* **Example (Day 1):** Incline DB Press (3x20), immediately followed by Push-ups (AMRAP) - rest 60 seconds. Repeat 3 times.\n\n**Weeks 5-7: Introducing Weight & Tempo**\n* **Key Changes:** Gradually increase weight used, maintaining proper form. Introduce tempo training – slowing down the eccentric (lowering) phase of the exercise (e.g., 3-1-1 tempo: 3 seconds down, 1 second pause, 1 second up).\n* **Example (Day 2):** Squats (3x15) with a 3-1-1 tempo.\n\n**Weeks 8-10:  Peak Endurance & Active Recovery Refinement**\n* **Key Changes:**  Focus on circuit training – performing a series of exercises with minimal rest between them. Increase cardio duration on active recovery days. Introduce plyometric exercises (jump squats, box jumps – *if* appropriate for rehabilitation).  Focus on mindfulness during recovery.\n* **Example (Day 5):** Circuit: Plank (30 sec), Russian Twists (20 reps), Bird Dog (10/side), Glute Bridges (15 reps) – repeat 3-4 times with 60 seconds rest between circuits.\n\n\n\n**Sample Weekly Split (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Monday:** Upper Body - Push (Supersets, Tempo)\n* **Tuesday:** Lower Body - Quad Focus (Weight Increase, Tempo)\n* **Wednesday:** Active Recovery (45 min Cardio, Foam Rolling)\n* **Thursday:** Upper Body - Pull (Supersets, Weight Increase)\n* **Friday:** Full Body Circuit Training (Plyometrics – *if* appropriate)\n* **Saturday:** Rest or Light Activity (Yoga, Walking)\n* **Sunday:** Rest\n\n\n\n**Final Notes from Anna Smirnova:**\n\nThis program is a journey, not a race.  There will be days when you feel fantastic, and days when you struggle.  That’s okay.  The key is consistency and listening to your body.  Don’t be afraid to modify exercises or take extra rest days when needed.  Remember why you started – whether it’s to rebuild strength, improve endurance, or simply feel better in your own skin.  Embrace the process, celebrate your progress, and believe in your ability to achieve your goals.  I’m here to support you on your journey.  Don't hesitate to seek professional guidance if you have any concerns.  You’ve got this!  Stay hydrated, fuel your body, and keep moving forward.  The Phoenix *will* rise.""}","17    {'Activity Type': 'CrossFit', 'Program Goal': ...

It prioritizes controlled movements, high reps, and active recovery.  The duration is kept to 30 minutes or less to minimize stress on the body while maximizing effectiveness.  Listen to your body, and *always* prioritize form over weight.  This is about rebuilding and becoming stronger, not ego lifting.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Medical Clearance:** *Crucially*, this program assumes you have been cleared by a doctor or physical therapist to engage in bodybuilding and endurance-focused exercises, especially considering the rehabilitation aspect.\n* **Nutrition:**  This program is *most* effective when paired with a diet rich in protein (1.6-2.2g/kg bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.  Hydration is paramount – aim for at least 3 liters of water daily. Consider supplementing with creatine monohydrate (3-5g/day) for enhanced endurance and recovery, and a multivitamin. Consult with a registered dietitian for personalized nutrition guidance.\n* **Form:** Watch videos of each exercise to ensure proper form. Incorrect form can negate benefits and increase injury risk.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase weight, reps, or sets each week, *only* if your form remains impeccable.\n* **Rest & Recovery:**  Adequate sleep (7-9 hours) is non-negotiable.  Active recovery days are vital.  Don't skip them!\n* **Listen to Your Body:**  If you experience pain, STOP. Modify the exercise or consult with a professional.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Activation (Focus: Re-establishing Neuromuscular Connection)**\n\n* **Frequency:** 5 days/week\n* **Intensity:** Low-Moderate\n\n**Day 1: Upper Body - Push**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio (light jogging/jumping jacks), dynamic stretching (arm circles, shoulder rotations).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Incline Dumbbell Press: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Push-ups (modified on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP), 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Shoulder Press: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Triceps Pushdowns (cable or band): 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (chest, shoulders, triceps) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements. Hydrate well.\n\n**Day 2: Lower Body - Quad Focus**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio (light cycling), dynamic stretching (leg swings, hip circles).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Bodyweight Squats: 3 sets of 20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Walking Lunges: 3 sets of 10 reps per leg, 60 sec rest\n    * Leg Extensions (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 45 sec rest\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (quads, hamstrings, calves) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n* **Note:** Maintain proper squat form – chest up, back straight.\n\n**Day 3: Active Recovery**\n* 30 minutes of low-intensity cardio (walking, swimming, cycling).  Focus on blood flow and gentle movement.\n* Foam rolling for major muscle groups.\n\n**Day 4: Upper Body - Pull**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio, dynamic stretching (arm circles, torso twists).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Lat Pulldowns (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 15-20 reps per arm, 60 sec rest\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n    * Bicep Curls (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (back, biceps) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n\n**Day 5: Core & Full Body**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio, dynamic stretching.\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds\n    * Russian Twists: 3 sets of 20 reps\n    * Bird Dog: 3 sets of 10 reps per side\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (core, glutes) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n\n---\n\n**Week 2-10: Progressive Overload & Endurance Building**\n\n*(The following is a summary. Each week will follow a similar structure to Week 1, but with progressive adjustments. I will outline key changes for each week, rather than repeating the full daily schedule.)*\n\n**Weeks 2-4: Increasing Volume**\n* **Key Changes:** Increase reps by 2-5 per set.  Introduce supersets (performing two exercises back-to-back with no rest). Reduce rest intervals to 45-60 seconds.  Introduce variations of exercises (e.g., incline dumbbell press to flat dumbbell press).\n* **Example (Day 1):** Incline DB Press (3x20), immediately followed by Push-ups (AMRAP) - rest 60 seconds. Repeat 3 times.\n\n**Weeks 5-7: Introducing Weight & Tempo**\n* **Key Changes:** Gradually increase weight used, maintaining proper form. Introduce tempo training – slowing down the eccentric (lowering) phase of the exercise (e.g., 3-1-1 tempo: 3 seconds down, 1 second pause, 1 second up).\n* **Example (Day 2):** Squats (3x15) with a 3-1-1 tempo.\n\n**Weeks 8-10:  Peak Endurance & Active Recovery Refinement**\n* **Key Changes:**  Focus on circuit training – performing a series of exercises with minimal rest between them. Increase cardio duration on active recovery days. Introduce plyometric exercises (jump squats, box jumps – *if* appropriate for rehabilitation).  Focus on mindfulness during recovery.\n* **Example (Day 5):** Circuit: Plank (30 sec), Russian Twists (20 reps), Bird Dog (10/side), Glute Bridges (15 reps) – repeat 3-4 times with 60 seconds rest between circuits.\n\n\n\n**Sample Weekly Split (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Monday:** Upper Body - Push (Supersets, Tempo)\n* **Tuesday:** Lower Body - Quad Focus (Weight Increase, Tempo)\n* **Wednesday:** Active Recovery (45 min Cardio, Foam Rolling)\n* **Thursday:** Upper Body - Pull (Supersets, Weight Increase)\n* **Friday:** Full Body Circuit Training (Plyometrics – *if* appropriate)\n* **Saturday:** Rest or Light Activity (Yoga, Walking)\n* **Sunday:** Rest\n\n\n\n**Final Notes from Anna Smirnova:**\n\nThis program is a journey, not a race.  There will be days when you feel fantastic, and days when you struggle.  That’s okay.  The key is consistency and listening to your body.  Don’t be afraid to modify exercises or take extra rest days when needed.  Remember why you started – whether it’s to rebuild strength, improve endurance, or simply feel better in your own skin.  Embrace the process, celebrate your progress, and believe in your ability to achieve your goals.  I’m here to support you on your journey.  Don't hesitate to seek professional guidance if you have any concerns.  You’ve got this!  Stay hydrated, fuel your body, and keep moving forward.

It prioritizes compound movements for maximum efficiency and incorporates periodization to prevent plateaus and optimize results.  We\'ll start with foundational strength and build towards more challenging variations.  Listen to your body, prioritize form, and remember consistency is key.  This program is designed for 1-2 workouts per week, allowing for adequate recovery.  If you feel exceptionally sore, take an extra rest day.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires a caloric surplus. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods. Consider a creatine supplement (3-5g daily) for enhanced strength and muscle growth (consult with a healthcare professional first).\n* **Warm-up:**  5-10 minutes of light cardio (jumping jacks, high knees, arm circles) and dynamic stretching (leg swings, torso twists, shoulder rotations) before each workout.\n* **Cool-down:** 5-10 minutes of static stretching (holding each stretch for 30 seconds) after each workout. Focus on the muscles worked.\n* **Progression:**  Each week, aim to increase the weight lifted (even slightly), the number of reps, or the number of sets. If you can comfortably complete all sets and reps with good form, it\'s time to increase the challenge.\n* **Form over Ego:**  Prioritize proper form above lifting heavy weight.  Incorrect form can lead to injury. Watch videos and, if possible, work with a qualified trainer to ensure you are performing exercises correctly.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Familiarization (Focus: Learning Form)**\n\n* **Day 1 (Monday): Full Body**\n    * Warm-up\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 8-12 reps per arm (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Overhead Press (Dumbbells): 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest 30 seconds)\n    * Cool-down\n    * *Note:* Focus on controlled movements.

It prioritizes compound movements for maximum efficiency and incorporates periodization to prevent plateaus and optimize results.  We\'ll start with foundational strength and build towards more challenging variations.  Listen to your body, prioritize form, and remember consistency is key.  This program is designed for 1-2 workouts per week, allowing for adequate recovery.  If you feel exceptionally sore, take an extra rest day.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires a caloric surplus. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods. Consider a creatine supplement (3-5g daily) for enhanced strength and muscle growth (consult with a healthcare professional first).\n* **Warm-up:**  5-10 minutes of light cardio (jumping jacks, high knees, arm circles) and dynamic stretching (leg swings, torso twists, shoulder rotations) before each workout.\n* **Cool-down:** 5-10 minutes of static stretching (holding each stretch for 30 seconds) after each workout. Focus on the muscles worked.\n* **Progression:**  Each week, aim to increase the weight lifted (even slightly), the number of reps, or the number of sets. If you can comfortably complete all sets and reps with good form, it\'s time to increase the challenge.\n* **Form over Ego:**  Prioritize proper form above lifting heavy weight.

If you can comfortably complete all sets and reps with good form, it\'s time to increase the challenge.\n* **Form over Ego:**  Prioritize proper form above lifting heavy weight.

This program is designed for beginners, focusing on building a solid foundation while maximizing muscle stimulation through High-Intensity Interval Training. Remember consistency is key! Listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and don't be afraid to modify exercises as needed.  We’ll focus on compound movements to get the most ‘bang for your buck’ and stimulate multiple muscle groups simultaneously.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, and increase intake on workout days.  Consider an electrolyte drink post-workout, especially if you sweat heavily.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires adequate protein intake. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.  Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Supplements (Optional):**  Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid muscle growth and performance.  Whey protein can help meet protein goals. *Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:**  Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night.  Active recovery (light cardio, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form Over Everything:** Watch videos of each exercise before attempting it. Focus on controlled movements and proper technique.  If you're unsure, start with bodyweight only.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Building the Foundation (3 workouts/week)**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body HIIT**\n* **Warm-up (5 mins):** Jumping jacks (30 secs), High knees (30 secs), Butt kicks (30 secs), Arm circles (forward & backward - 30 secs each), Dynamic stretches (leg swings, torso twists - 1 min)\n* **Workout (25 mins):**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (60 secs rest)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (60 secs rest)\n    * Walking Lunges: 3 sets of 10 reps per leg (60 secs rest)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-45 secs (60 secs rest)\n    * Burpees (modified - step back instead of jump): 3 sets of 8-10 reps (60 secs rest)\n* **Cool-down (5 mins):** Static stretches (hold each stretch for 30 secs) - Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch.\n* **Notes:** Focus on mastering the form of each exercise.

Listen to your body, and don't hesitate to modify exercises if needed.

It prioritizes controlled movements, high reps, and active recovery.  The duration is kept to 30 minutes or less to minimize stress on the body while maximizing effectiveness.

Hydration is paramount – aim for at least 3 liters of water daily. Consider supplementing with creatine monohydrate (3-5g/day) for enhanced endurance and recovery, and a multivitamin. Consult with a registered dietitian for personalized nutrition guidance.\n* **Form:** Watch videos of each exercise to ensure proper form. Incorrect form can negate benefits and increase injury risk.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase weight, reps, or sets each week, *only* if your form remains impeccable.\n* **Rest & Recovery:**  Adequate sleep (7-9 hours) is non-negotiable.  Active recovery days are vital.  Don't skip them!\n* **Listen to Your Body:**  If you experience pain, STOP. Modify the exercise or consult with a professional.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Activation (Focus: Re-establishing Neuromuscular Connection)**\n\n* **Frequency:** 5 days/week\n* **Intensity:** Low-Moderate\n\n**Day 1: Upper Body - Push**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio (light jogging/jumping jacks), dynamic stretching (arm circles, shoulder rotations).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Incline Dumbbell Press: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Push-ups (modified on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP), 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Shoulder Press: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Triceps Pushdowns (cable or band): 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (chest, shoulders, triceps) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements. Hydrate well.\n\n**Day 2: Lower Body - Quad Focus**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio (light cycling), dynamic stretching (leg swings, hip circles).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Bodyweight Squats: 3 sets of 20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Walking Lunges: 3 sets of 10 reps per leg, 60 sec rest\n    * Leg Extensions (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 45 sec rest\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (quads, hamstrings, calves) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n* **Note:** Maintain proper squat form – chest up, back straight.\n\n**Day 3: Active Recovery**\n* 30 minutes of low-intensity cardio (walking, swimming, cycling).  Focus on blood flow and gentle movement.\n* Foam rolling for major muscle groups.\n\n**Day 4: Upper Body - Pull**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio, dynamic stretching (arm circles, torso twists).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Lat Pulldowns (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 15-20 reps per arm, 60 sec rest\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n    * Bicep Curls (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (back, biceps) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n\n**Day 5: Core & Full Body**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio, dynamic stretching.\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds\n    * Russian Twists: 3 sets of 20 reps\n    * Bird Dog: 3 sets of 10 reps per side\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (core, glutes) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n\n---\n\n**Week 2-10: Progressive Overload & Endurance Building**\n\n*(The following is a summary. Each week will follow a similar structure to Week 1, but with progressive adjustments. I will outline key changes for each week, rather than repeating the full daily schedule.)*\n\n**Weeks 2-4: Increasing Volume**\n* **Key Changes:** Increase reps by 2-5 per set.  Introduce supersets (performing two exercises back-to-back with no rest). Reduce rest intervals to 45-60 seconds.  Introduce variations of exercises (e.g., incline dumbbell press to flat dumbbell press).\n* **Example (Day 1):** Incline DB Press (3x20), immediately followed by Push-ups (AMRAP) - rest 60 seconds. Repeat 3 times.\n\n**Weeks 5-7: Introducing Weight & Tempo**\n* **Key Changes:** Gradually increase weight used, maintaining proper form. Introduce tempo training – slowing down the eccentric (lowering) phase of the exercise (e.g., 3-1-1 tempo: 3 seconds down, 1 second pause, 1 second up).\n* **Example (Day 2):** Squats (3x15) with a 3-1-1 tempo.\n\n**Weeks 8-10:  Peak Endurance & Active Recovery Refinement**\n* **Key Changes:**  Focus on circuit training – performing a series of exercises with minimal rest between them. Increase cardio duration on active recovery days. Introduce plyometric exercises (jump squats, box jumps – *if* appropriate for rehabilitation).  Focus on mindfulness during recovery.\n* **Example (Day 5):** Circuit: Plank (30 sec), Russian Twists (20 reps), Bird Dog (10/side), Glute Bridges (15 reps) – repeat 3-4 times with 60 seconds rest between circuits.\n\n\n\n**Sample Weekly Split (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Monday:** Upper Body - Push (Supersets, Tempo)\n* **Tuesday:** Lower Body - Quad Focus (Weight Increase, Tempo)\n* **Wednesday:** Active Recovery (45 min Cardio, Foam Rolling)\n* **Thursday:** Upper Body - Pull (Supersets, Weight Increase)\n* **Friday:** Full Body Circuit Training (Plyometrics – *if* appropriate)\n* **Saturday:** Rest or Light Activity (Yoga, Walking)\n* **Sunday:** Rest\n\n\n\n**Final Notes from Anna Smirnova:**\n\nThis program is a journey, not a race.  There will be days when you feel fantastic, and days when you struggle.  That’s okay.  The key is consistency and listening to your body.  Don’t be afraid to modify exercises or take extra rest days when needed.  Remember why you started – whether it’s to rebuild strength, improve endurance, or simply feel better in your own skin.  Embrace the process, celebrate your progress, and believe in your ability to achieve your goals.  I’m here to support you on your journey.  Don't hesitate to seek professional guidance if you have any concerns.  You’ve got this!  Stay hydrated, fuel your body, and keep moving forward.

It prioritizes controlled movements, high reps, and active recovery.  The duration is kept to 30 minutes or less to minimize stress on the body while maximizing effectiveness.  Listen to your body, and *always* prioritize form over weight.  This is about rebuilding and becoming stronger, not ego lifting.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Medical Clearance:** *Crucially*, this program assumes you have been cleared by a doctor or physical therapist to engage in bodybuilding and endurance-focused exercises, especially considering the rehabilitation aspect.\n* **Nutrition:**  This program is *most* effective when paired with a diet rich in protein (1.6-2.2g/kg bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.  Hydration is paramount – aim for at least 3 liters of water daily. Consider supplementing with creatine monohydrate (3-5g/day) for enhanced endurance and recovery, and a multivitamin. Consult with a registered dietitian for personalized nutrition guidance.\n* **Form:** Watch videos of each exercise to ensure proper form. Incorrect form can negate benefits and increase injury risk.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase weight, reps, or sets each week, *only* if your form remains impeccable.\n* **Rest & Recovery:**  Adequate sleep (7-9 hours) is non-negotiable.  Active recovery days are vital.  Don't skip them!\n* **Listen to Your Body:**  If you experience pain, STOP. Modify the exercise or consult with a professional.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Activation (Focus: Re-establishing Neuromuscular Connection)**\n\n* **Frequency:** 5 days/week\n* **Intensity:** Low-Moderate\n\n**Day 1: Upper Body - Push**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio (light jogging/jumping jacks), dynamic stretching (arm circles, shoulder rotations).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Incline Dumbbell Press: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Push-ups (modified on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP), 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Shoulder Press: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Triceps Pushdowns (cable or band): 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (chest, shoulders, triceps) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements. Hydrate well.\n\n**Day 2: Lower Body - Quad Focus**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio (light cycling), dynamic stretching (leg swings, hip circles).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Bodyweight Squats: 3 sets of 20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Walking Lunges: 3 sets of 10 reps per leg, 60 sec rest\n    * Leg Extensions (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 45 sec rest\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (quads, hamstrings, calves) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n* **Note:** Maintain proper squat form – chest up, back straight.\n\n**Day 3: Active Recovery**\n* 30 minutes of low-intensity cardio (walking, swimming, cycling).  Focus on blood flow and gentle movement.\n* Foam rolling for major muscle groups.\n\n**Day 4: Upper Body - Pull**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio, dynamic stretching (arm circles, torso twists).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Lat Pulldowns (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 15-20 reps per arm, 60 sec rest\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n    * Bicep Curls (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (back, biceps) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n\n**Day 5: Core & Full Body**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio, dynamic stretching.\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds\n    * Russian Twists: 3 sets of 20 reps\n    * Bird Dog: 3 sets of 10 reps per side\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (core, glutes) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n\n---\n\n**Week 2-10: Progressive Overload & Endurance Building**\n\n*(The following is a summary. Each week will follow a similar structure to Week 1, but with progressive adjustments. I will outline key changes for each week, rather than repeating the full daily schedule.)*\n\n**Weeks 2-4: Increasing Volume**\n* **Key Changes:** Increase reps by 2-5 per set.  Introduce supersets (performing two exercises back-to-back with no rest). Reduce rest intervals to 45-60 seconds.  Introduce variations of exercises (e.g., incline dumbbell press to flat dumbbell press).\n* **Example (Day 1):** Incline DB Press (3x20), immediately followed by Push-ups (AMRAP) - rest 60 seconds. Repeat 3 times.\n\n**Weeks 5-7: Introducing Weight & Tempo**\n* **Key Changes:** Gradually increase weight used, maintaining proper form. Introduce tempo training – slowing down the eccentric (lowering) phase of the exercise (e.g., 3-1-1 tempo: 3 seconds down, 1 second pause, 1 second up).\n* **Example (Day 2):** Squats (3x15) with a 3-1-1 tempo.\n\n**Weeks 8-10:  Peak Endurance & Active Recovery Refinement**\n* **Key Changes:**  Focus on circuit training – performing a series of exercises with minimal rest between them. Increase cardio duration on active recovery days. Introduce plyometric exercises (jump squats, box jumps – *if* appropriate for rehabilitation).  Focus on mindfulness during recovery.\n* **Example (Day 5):** Circuit: Plank (30 sec), Russian Twists (20 reps), Bird Dog (10/side), Glute Bridges (15 reps) – repeat 3-4 times with 60 seconds rest between circuits.\n\n\n\n**Sample Weekly Split (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Monday:** Upper Body - Push (Supersets, Tempo)\n* **Tuesday:** Lower Body - Quad Focus (Weight Increase, Tempo)\n* **Wednesday:** Active Recovery (45 min Cardio, Foam Rolling)\n* **Thursday:** Upper Body - Pull (Supersets, Weight Increase)\n* **Friday:** Full Body Circuit Training (Plyometrics – *if* appropriate)\n* **Saturday:** Rest or Light Activity (Yoga, Walking)\n* **Sunday:** Rest\n\n\n\n**Final Notes from Anna Smirnova:**\n\nThis program is a journey, not a race.  There will be days when you feel fantastic, and days when you struggle.  That’s okay.  The key is consistency and listening to your body.  Don’t be afraid to modify exercises or take extra rest days when needed.  Remember why you started – whether it’s to rebuild strength, improve endurance, or simply feel better in your own skin.  Embrace the process, celebrate your progress, and believe in your ability to achieve your goals.  I’m here to support you on your journey.  Don't hesitate to seek professional guidance if you have any concerns.  You’ve got this!  Stay hydrated, fuel your body, and keep moving forward.  The Phoenix *will* rise.""}","70    {'Activity Type': 'CrossFit', 'Program Goal': ...

It prioritizes compound movements for maximum efficiency and incorporates periodization to prevent plateaus and optimize results.  We\'ll start with foundational strength and build towards more challenging variations.  Listen to your body, prioritize form, and remember consistency is key.  This program is designed for 1-2 workouts per week, allowing for adequate recovery.  If you feel exceptionally sore, take an extra rest day.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires a caloric surplus. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods. Consider a creatine supplement (3-5g daily) for enhanced strength and muscle growth (consult with a healthcare professional first).\n* **Warm-up:**  5-10 minutes of light cardio (jumping jacks, high knees, arm circles) and dynamic stretching (leg swings, torso twists, shoulder rotations) before each workout.\n* **Cool-down:** 5-10 minutes of static stretching (holding each stretch for 30 seconds) after each workout. Focus on the muscles worked.\n* **Progression:**  Each week, aim to increase the weight lifted (even slightly), the number of reps, or the number of sets. If you can comfortably complete all sets and reps with good form, it\'s time to increase the challenge.\n* **Form over Ego:**  Prioritize proper form above lifting heavy weight.  Incorrect form can lead to injury. Watch videos and, if possible, work with a qualified trainer to ensure you are performing exercises correctly.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Familiarization (Focus: Learning Form)**\n\n* **Day 1 (Monday): Full Body**\n    * Warm-up\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 8-12 reps per arm (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Overhead Press (Dumbbells): 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest 30 seconds)\n    * Cool-down\n    * *Note:* Focus on controlled movements.

I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","29    {'Activity Type': 'Strength Training', 'Progra...

Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.  YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","113    {'Activity Type': 'HIIT', 'Program Goal': ['Mu...

This program is designed for beginners with little to no prior weightlifting experience. We'll focus on proper form, progressive overload, and consistent stretching to achieve both muscle growth and increased range of motion.\n\n**Trainer:** Maria Kuznetsova, NASM Certified Personal Trainer (Basic)\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when you need to. Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.  YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.

Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.

I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.

Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency.

This program is designed for beginners with little to no prior weightlifting experience. We'll focus on proper form, progressive overload, and consistent stretching to achieve both muscle growth and increased range of motion.\n\n**Trainer:** Maria Kuznetsova, NASM Certified Personal Trainer (Basic)\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when you need to. Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.

I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.

Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.

I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.

Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.

I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.

Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!

Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.

Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","103    {'Activity Type': 'Bodybuilding', 'Program Goa...

It focuses on full-body strength training with an emphasis on proper form and progressive overload. Remember, consistency is key! Listen to your body, and don't hesitate to modify exercises if needed. I, Maria Kuznetsova, am here to guide you on this journey.\n\n**Important Notes Before You Begin:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, and increase intake on workout days. Consider adding electrolytes if you sweat heavily.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. This program doesn’t include a detailed diet plan, but prioritize whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** A daily multivitamin can be beneficial.  Consider a protein supplement if you struggle to meet your protein needs through diet alone. *Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:**  Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Active recovery (light walking, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form Over Everything:** Watch videos of each exercise to ensure proper form. If you’re unsure, consider working with a qualified fitness professional for a session or two.\n* **Progressive Overload:**  As exercises become easier, gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets. This is crucial for continued progress.\n* **Listen to Your Body:**  Rest when you need to. Don't push through pain.

It prioritizes controlled movements, high reps, and active recovery.  The duration is kept to 30 minutes or less to minimize stress on the body while maximizing effectiveness.  Listen to your body, and *always* prioritize form over weight.  This is about rebuilding and becoming stronger, not ego lifting.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Medical Clearance:** *Crucially*, this program assumes you have been cleared by a doctor or physical therapist to engage in bodybuilding and endurance-focused exercises, especially considering the rehabilitation aspect.\n* **Nutrition:**  This program is *most* effective when paired with a diet rich in protein (1.6-2.2g/kg bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.  Hydration is paramount – aim for at least 3 liters of water daily. Consider supplementing with creatine monohydrate (3-5g/day) for enhanced endurance and recovery, and a multivitamin. Consult with a registered dietitian for personalized nutrition guidance.\n* **Form:** Watch videos of each exercise to ensure proper form. Incorrect form can negate benefits and increase injury risk.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase weight, reps, or sets each week, *only* if your form remains impeccable.\n* **Rest & Recovery:**  Adequate sleep (7-9 hours) is non-negotiable.  Active recovery days are vital.  Don't skip them!\n* **Listen to Your Body:**  If you experience pain, STOP. Modify the exercise or consult with a professional.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Activation (Focus: Re-establishing Neuromuscular Connection)**\n\n* **Frequency:** 5 days/week\n* **Intensity:** Low-Moderate\n\n**Day 1: Upper Body - Push**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio (light jogging/jumping jacks), dynamic stretching (arm circles, shoulder rotations).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Incline Dumbbell Press: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Push-ups (modified on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP), 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Shoulder Press: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Triceps Pushdowns (cable or band): 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (chest, shoulders, triceps) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements. Hydrate well.\n\n**Day 2: Lower Body - Quad Focus**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio (light cycling), dynamic stretching (leg swings, hip circles).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Bodyweight Squats: 3 sets of 20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Walking Lunges: 3 sets of 10 reps per leg, 60 sec rest\n    * Leg Extensions (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 45 sec rest\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (quads, hamstrings, calves) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n* **Note:** Maintain proper squat form – chest up, back straight.\n\n**Day 3: Active Recovery**\n* 30 minutes of low-intensity cardio (walking, swimming, cycling).  Focus on blood flow and gentle movement.\n* Foam rolling for major muscle groups.\n\n**Day 4: Upper Body - Pull**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio, dynamic stretching (arm circles, torso twists).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Lat Pulldowns (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 15-20 reps per arm, 60 sec rest\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n    * Bicep Curls (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (back, biceps) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n\n**Day 5: Core & Full Body**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio, dynamic stretching.\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds\n    * Russian Twists: 3 sets of 20 reps\n    * Bird Dog: 3 sets of 10 reps per side\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (core, glutes) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n\n---\n\n**Week 2-10: Progressive Overload & Endurance Building**\n\n*(The following is a summary. Each week will follow a similar structure to Week 1, but with progressive adjustments. I will outline key changes for each week, rather than repeating the full daily schedule.)*\n\n**Weeks 2-4: Increasing Volume**\n* **Key Changes:** Increase reps by 2-5 per set.  Introduce supersets (performing two exercises back-to-back with no rest). Reduce rest intervals to 45-60 seconds.  Introduce variations of exercises (e.g., incline dumbbell press to flat dumbbell press).\n* **Example (Day 1):** Incline DB Press (3x20), immediately followed by Push-ups (AMRAP) - rest 60 seconds. Repeat 3 times.\n\n**Weeks 5-7: Introducing Weight & Tempo**\n* **Key Changes:** Gradually increase weight used, maintaining proper form. Introduce tempo training – slowing down the eccentric (lowering) phase of the exercise (e.g., 3-1-1 tempo: 3 seconds down, 1 second pause, 1 second up).\n* **Example (Day 2):** Squats (3x15) with a 3-1-1 tempo.\n\n**Weeks 8-10:  Peak Endurance & Active Recovery Refinement**\n* **Key Changes:**  Focus on circuit training – performing a series of exercises with minimal rest between them. Increase cardio duration on active recovery days. Introduce plyometric exercises (jump squats, box jumps – *if* appropriate for rehabilitation).  Focus on mindfulness during recovery.\n* **Example (Day 5):** Circuit: Plank (30 sec), Russian Twists (20 reps), Bird Dog (10/side), Glute Bridges (15 reps) – repeat 3-4 times with 60 seconds rest between circuits.\n\n\n\n**Sample Weekly Split (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Monday:** Upper Body - Push (Supersets, Tempo)\n* **Tuesday:** Lower Body - Quad Focus (Weight Increase, Tempo)\n* **Wednesday:** Active Recovery (45 min Cardio, Foam Rolling)\n* **Thursday:** Upper Body - Pull (Supersets, Weight Increase)\n* **Friday:** Full Body Circuit Training (Plyometrics – *if* appropriate)\n* **Saturday:** Rest or Light Activity (Yoga, Walking)\n* **Sunday:** Rest\n\n\n\n**Final Notes from Anna Smirnova:**\n\nThis program is a journey, not a race.  There will be days when you feel fantastic, and days when you struggle.  That’s okay.  The key is consistency and listening to your body.  Don’t be afraid to modify exercises or take extra rest days when needed.  Remember why you started – whether it’s to rebuild strength, improve endurance, or simply feel better in your own skin.  Embrace the process, celebrate your progress, and believe in your ability to achieve your goals.  I’m here to support you on your journey.  Don't hesitate to seek professional guidance if you have any concerns.  You’ve got this!  Stay hydrated, fuel your body, and keep moving forward.  The Phoenix *will* rise.""}","11    {'Activity Type': 'Boxing/Martial Arts', 'Prog...

It prioritizes controlled movements, high reps, and active recovery.  The duration is kept to 30 minutes or less to minimize stress on the body while maximizing effectiveness.  Listen to your body, and *always* prioritize form over weight.  This is about rebuilding and becoming stronger, not ego lifting.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Medical Clearance:** *Crucially*, this program assumes you have been cleared by a doctor or physical therapist to engage in bodybuilding and endurance-focused exercises, especially considering the rehabilitation aspect.\n* **Nutrition:**  This program is *most* effective when paired with a diet rich in protein (1.6-2.2g/kg bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.  Hydration is paramount – aim for at least 3 liters of water daily. Consider supplementing with creatine monohydrate (3-5g/day) for enhanced endurance and recovery, and a multivitamin. Consult with a registered dietitian for personalized nutrition guidance.\n* **Form:** Watch videos of each exercise to ensure proper form. Incorrect form can negate benefits and increase injury risk.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase weight, reps, or sets each week, *only* if your form remains impeccable.\n* **Rest & Recovery:**  Adequate sleep (7-9 hours) is non-negotiable.  Active recovery days are vital.  Don't skip them!\n* **Listen to Your Body:**  If you experience pain, STOP. Modify the exercise or consult with a professional.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Activation (Focus: Re-establishing Neuromuscular Connection)**\n\n* **Frequency:** 5 days/week\n* **Intensity:** Low-Moderate\n\n**Day 1: Upper Body - Push**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio (light jogging/jumping jacks), dynamic stretching (arm circles, shoulder rotations).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Incline Dumbbell Press: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Push-ups (modified on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP), 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Shoulder Press: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Triceps Pushdowns (cable or band): 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (chest, shoulders, triceps) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements. Hydrate well.\n\n**Day 2: Lower Body - Quad Focus**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio (light cycling), dynamic stretching (leg swings, hip circles).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Bodyweight Squats: 3 sets of 20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Walking Lunges: 3 sets of 10 reps per leg, 60 sec rest\n    * Leg Extensions (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 45 sec rest\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (quads, hamstrings, calves) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n* **Note:** Maintain proper squat form – chest up, back straight.\n\n**Day 3: Active Recovery**\n* 30 minutes of low-intensity cardio (walking, swimming, cycling).  Focus on blood flow and gentle movement.\n* Foam rolling for major muscle groups.\n\n**Day 4: Upper Body - Pull**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio, dynamic stretching (arm circles, torso twists).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Lat Pulldowns (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 15-20 reps per arm, 60 sec rest\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n    * Bicep Curls (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (back, biceps) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n\n**Day 5: Core & Full Body**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio, dynamic stretching.\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds\n    * Russian Twists: 3 sets of 20 reps\n    * Bird Dog: 3 sets of 10 reps per side\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (core, glutes) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n\n---\n\n**Week 2-10: Progressive Overload & Endurance Building**\n\n*(The following is a summary. Each week will follow a similar structure to Week 1, but with progressive adjustments. I will outline key changes for each week, rather than repeating the full daily schedule.)*\n\n**Weeks 2-4: Increasing Volume**\n* **Key Changes:** Increase reps by 2-5 per set.  Introduce supersets (performing two exercises back-to-back with no rest). Reduce rest intervals to 45-60 seconds.  Introduce variations of exercises (e.g., incline dumbbell press to flat dumbbell press).\n* **Example (Day 1):** Incline DB Press (3x20), immediately followed by Push-ups (AMRAP) - rest 60 seconds. Repeat 3 times.\n\n**Weeks 5-7: Introducing Weight & Tempo**\n* **Key Changes:** Gradually increase weight used, maintaining proper form. Introduce tempo training – slowing down the eccentric (lowering) phase of the exercise (e.g., 3-1-1 tempo: 3 seconds down, 1 second pause, 1 second up).\n* **Example (Day 2):** Squats (3x15) with a 3-1-1 tempo.\n\n**Weeks 8-10:  Peak Endurance & Active Recovery Refinement**\n* **Key Changes:**  Focus on circuit training – performing a series of exercises with minimal rest between them. Increase cardio duration on active recovery days. Introduce plyometric exercises (jump squats, box jumps – *if* appropriate for rehabilitation).  Focus on mindfulness during recovery.\n* **Example (Day 5):** Circuit: Plank (30 sec), Russian Twists (20 reps), Bird Dog (10/side), Glute Bridges (15 reps) – repeat 3-4 times with 60 seconds rest between circuits.\n\n\n\n**Sample Weekly Split (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Monday:** Upper Body - Push (Supersets, Tempo)\n* **Tuesday:** Lower Body - Quad Focus (Weight Increase, Tempo)\n* **Wednesday:** Active Recovery (45 min Cardio, Foam Rolling)\n* **Thursday:** Upper Body - Pull (Supersets, Weight Increase)\n* **Friday:** Full Body Circuit Training (Plyometrics – *if* appropriate)\n* **Saturday:** Rest or Light Activity (Yoga, Walking)\n* **Sunday:** Rest\n\n\n\n**Final Notes from Anna Smirnova:**\n\nThis program is a journey, not a race.  There will be days when you feel fantastic, and days when you struggle.  That’s okay.  The key is consistency and listening to your body.  Don’t be afraid to modify exercises or take extra rest days when needed.  Remember why you started – whether it’s to rebuild strength, improve endurance, or simply feel better in your own skin.  Embrace the process, celebrate your progress, and believe in your ability to achieve your goals.  I’m here to support you on your journey.  Don't hesitate to seek professional guidance if you have any concerns.  You’ve got this!  Stay hydrated, fuel your body, and keep moving forward.  The Phoenix *will* rise.""}","17    {'Activity Type': 'CrossFit', 'Program Goal': ...

Increase cardio duration on active recovery days. Introduce plyometric exercises (jump squats, box jumps – *if* appropriate for rehabilitation).  Focus on mindfulness during recovery.\n* **Example (Day 5):** Circuit: Plank (30 sec), Russian Twists (20 reps), Bird Dog (10/side), Glute Bridges (15 reps) – repeat 3-4 times with 60 seconds rest between circuits.\n\n\n\n**Sample Weekly Split (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Monday:** Upper Body - Push (Supersets, Tempo)\n* **Tuesday:** Lower Body - Quad Focus (Weight Increase, Tempo)\n* **Wednesday:** Active Recovery (45 min Cardio, Foam Rolling)\n* **Thursday:** Upper Body - Pull (Supersets, Weight Increase)\n* **Friday:** Full Body Circuit Training (Plyometrics – *if* appropriate)\n* **Saturday:** Rest or Light Activity (Yoga, Walking)\n* **Sunday:** Rest\n\n\n\n**Final Notes from Anna Smirnova:**\n\nThis program is a journey, not a race.  There will be days when you feel fantastic, and days when you struggle.  That’s okay.  The key is consistency and listening to your body.  Don’t be afraid to modify exercises or take extra rest days when needed.  Remember why you started – whether it’s to rebuild strength, improve endurance, or simply feel better in your own skin.  Embrace the process, celebrate your progress, and believe in your ability to achieve your goals.  I’m here to support you on your journey.  Don't hesitate to seek professional guidance if you have any concerns.  You’ve got this!  Stay hydrated, fuel your body, and keep moving forward.  The Phoenix *will* rise.""}","38    {'Activity Type': 'Bodybuilding', 'Program Goa...

It focuses on a split routine, targeting different muscle groups on different days to allow for adequate recovery.  We'll combine strength training with principles of progressive overload to build muscle while maintaining a caloric deficit for weight loss.  Consistency, proper form, and adequate nutrition are key to success.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Nutrition:** This program *requires* a calorie-controlled diet with sufficient protein (around 1 gram per pound of body weight). Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water daily, especially before, during, and after workouts.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (5g/day) can aid in muscle recovery and performance. Whey protein can help meet protein needs. Consult your doctor before starting any new supplement.\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Active recovery (light cardio, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form over Weight:**  Always prioritize proper form to prevent injuries.

This program is designed for beginners with little to no prior weightlifting experience. We'll focus on proper form, progressive overload, and consistent stretching to achieve both muscle growth and increased range of motion.\n\n**Trainer:** Maria Kuznetsova, NASM Certified Personal Trainer (Basic)\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when you need to. Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.  YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","55    {'Activity Type': 'Boxing/Martial Arts', 'Prog...

I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.

Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!

Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.

Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","3    {'Activity Type': 'HIIT', 'Program Goal': ['Mu...

It prioritizes compound movements for maximum efficiency and incorporates periodization to prevent plateaus and optimize results.  We\'ll start with foundational strength and build towards more challenging variations.  Listen to your body, prioritize form, and remember consistency is key.  This program is designed for 1-2 workouts per week, allowing for adequate recovery.  If you feel exceptionally sore, take an extra rest day.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires a caloric surplus. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods. Consider a creatine supplement (3-5g daily) for enhanced strength and muscle growth (consult with a healthcare professional first).\n* **Warm-up:**  5-10 minutes of light cardio (jumping jacks, high knees, arm circles) and dynamic stretching (leg swings, torso twists, shoulder rotations) before each workout.\n* **Cool-down:** 5-10 minutes of static stretching (holding each stretch for 30 seconds) after each workout. Focus on the muscles worked.\n* **Progression:**  Each week, aim to increase the weight lifted (even slightly), the number of reps, or the number of sets. If you can comfortably complete all sets and reps with good form, it\'s time to increase the challenge.\n* **Form over Ego:**  Prioritize proper form above lifting heavy weight.  Incorrect form can lead to injury. Watch videos and, if possible, work with a qualified trainer to ensure you are performing exercises correctly.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Familiarization (Focus: Learning Form)**\n\n* **Day 1 (Monday): Full Body**\n    * Warm-up\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 8-12 reps per arm (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Overhead Press (Dumbbells): 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest 30 seconds)\n    * Cool-down\n    * *Note:* Focus on controlled movements.

It prioritizes compound movements for maximum efficiency and incorporates periodization to prevent plateaus and optimize results.  We\'ll start with foundational strength and build towards more challenging variations.  Listen to your body, prioritize form, and remember consistency is key.

It prioritizes compound movements for maximum efficiency and incorporates periodization to prevent plateaus and optimize results.  We\'ll start with foundational strength and build towards more challenging variations.  Listen to your body, prioritize form, and remember consistency is key.  This program is designed for 1-2 workouts per week, allowing for adequate recovery.  If you feel exceptionally sore, take an extra rest day.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires a caloric surplus. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods. Consider a creatine supplement (3-5g daily) for enhanced strength and muscle growth (consult with a healthcare professional first).\n* **Warm-up:**  5-10 minutes of light cardio (jumping jacks, high knees, arm circles) and dynamic stretching (leg swings, torso twists, shoulder rotations) before each workout.\n* **Cool-down:** 5-10 minutes of static stretching (holding each stretch for 30 seconds) after each workout. Focus on the muscles worked.\n* **Progression:**  Each week, aim to increase the weight lifted (even slightly), the number of reps, or the number of sets. If you can comfortably complete all sets and reps with good form, it\'s time to increase the challenge.\n* **Form over Ego:**  Prioritize proper form above lifting heavy weight.  Incorrect form can lead to injury. Watch videos and, if possible, work with a qualified trainer to ensure you are performing exercises correctly.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Familiarization (Focus: Learning Form)**\n\n* **Day 1 (Monday): Full Body**\n    * Warm-up\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 8-12 reps per arm (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Overhead Press (Dumbbells): 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest 30 seconds)\n    * Cool-down\n    * *Note:* Focus on controlled movements.

This program is designed for beginners with little to no prior weightlifting experience. We'll focus on proper form, progressive overload, and consistent stretching to achieve both muscle growth and increased range of motion.\n\n**Trainer:** Maria Kuznetsova, NASM Certified Personal Trainer (Basic)\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when you need to. Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.  YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","42    {'Activity Type': 'Bodybuilding', 'Program Goa...

Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency.

Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.

I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.

Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.

This program is designed for beginners with little to no prior weightlifting experience. We'll focus on proper form, progressive overload, and consistent stretching to achieve both muscle growth and increased range of motion.\n\n**Trainer:** Maria Kuznetsova, NASM Certified Personal Trainer (Basic)\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when you need to. Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.  YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","95    {'Activity Type': 'Stretching', 'Program Goal'...

This program is designed for beginners, focusing on building a solid foundation while maximizing muscle stimulation through High-Intensity Interval Training. Remember consistency is key! Listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and don't be afraid to modify exercises as needed.  We’ll focus on compound movements to get the most ‘bang for your buck’ and stimulate multiple muscle groups simultaneously.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, and increase intake on workout days.  Consider an electrolyte drink post-workout, especially if you sweat heavily.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires adequate protein intake. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.  Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Supplements (Optional):**  Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid muscle growth and performance.  Whey protein can help meet protein goals. *Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:**  Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night.  Active recovery (light cardio, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form Over Everything:** Watch videos of each exercise before attempting it.

This program is designed for beginners, focusing on building a solid foundation while maximizing muscle stimulation through High-Intensity Interval Training. Remember consistency is key! Listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and don't be afraid to modify exercises as needed.  We’ll focus on compound movements to get the most ‘bang for your buck’ and stimulate multiple muscle groups simultaneously.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, and increase intake on workout days.  Consider an electrolyte drink post-workout, especially if you sweat heavily.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires adequate protein intake. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.  Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Supplements (Optional):**  Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid muscle growth and performance.  Whey protein can help meet protein goals. *Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:**  Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night.

This program is designed for beginners, focusing on building a solid foundation while maximizing muscle stimulation through High-Intensity Interval Training. Remember consistency is key! Listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and don't be afraid to modify exercises as needed.  We’ll focus on compound movements to get the most ‘bang for your buck’ and stimulate multiple muscle groups simultaneously.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, and increase intake on workout days.  Consider an electrolyte drink post-workout, especially if you sweat heavily.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires adequate protein intake. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.  Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Supplements (Optional):**  Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid muscle growth and performance.  Whey protein can help meet protein goals. *Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:**  Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night.  Active recovery (light cardio, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form Over Everything:** Watch videos of each exercise before attempting it. Focus on controlled movements and proper technique.  If you're unsure, start with bodyweight only.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Building the Foundation (3 workouts/week)**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body HIIT**\n* **Warm-up (5 mins):** Jumping jacks (30 secs), High knees (30 secs), Butt kicks (30 secs), Arm circles (forward & backward - 30 secs each), Dynamic stretches (leg swings, torso twists - 1 min)\n* **Workout (25 mins):**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (60 secs rest)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (60 secs rest)\n    * Walking Lunges: 3 sets of 10 reps per leg (60 secs rest)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-45 secs (60 secs rest)\n    * Burpees (modified - step back instead of jump): 3 sets of 8-10 reps (60 secs rest)\n* **Cool-down (5 mins):** Static stretches (hold each stretch for 30 secs) - Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch.\n* **Notes:** Focus on mastering the form of each exercise.

Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","0    {'Activity Type': 'Boxing/Martial Arts', 'Prog...

Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets.

This program is designed for beginners with little to no prior weightlifting experience. We'll focus on proper form, progressive overload, and consistent stretching to achieve both muscle growth and increased range of motion.\n\n**Trainer:** Maria Kuznetsova, NASM Certified Personal Trainer (Basic)\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when you need to. Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.  YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","74    {'Activity Type': 'Strength Training', 'Progra...

It prioritizes controlled movements, high reps, and active recovery.  The duration is kept to 30 minutes or less to minimize stress on the body while maximizing effectiveness.  Listen to your body, and *always* prioritize form over weight.  This is about rebuilding and becoming stronger, not ego lifting.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Medical Clearance:** *Crucially*, this program assumes you have been cleared by a doctor or physical therapist to engage in bodybuilding and endurance-focused exercises, especially considering the rehabilitation aspect.\n* **Nutrition:**  This program is *most* effective when paired with a diet rich in protein (1.6-2.2g/kg bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.  Hydration is paramount – aim for at least 3 liters of water daily. Consider supplementing with creatine monohydrate (3-5g/day) for enhanced endurance and recovery, and a multivitamin. Consult with a registered dietitian for personalized nutrition guidance.\n* **Form:** Watch videos of each exercise to ensure proper form. Incorrect form can negate benefits and increase injury risk.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase weight, reps, or sets each week, *only* if your form remains impeccable.\n* **Rest & Recovery:**  Adequate sleep (7-9 hours) is non-negotiable.  Active recovery days are vital.  Don't skip them!\n* **Listen to Your Body:**  If you experience pain, STOP. Modify the exercise or consult with a professional.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Activation (Focus: Re-establishing Neuromuscular Connection)**\n\n* **Frequency:** 5 days/week\n* **Intensity:** Low-Moderate\n\n**Day 1: Upper Body - Push**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio (light jogging/jumping jacks), dynamic stretching (arm circles, shoulder rotations).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Incline Dumbbell Press: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Push-ups (modified on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP), 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Shoulder Press: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Triceps Pushdowns (cable or band): 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (chest, shoulders, triceps) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements. Hydrate well.\n\n**Day 2: Lower Body - Quad Focus**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio (light cycling), dynamic stretching (leg swings, hip circles).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Bodyweight Squats: 3 sets of 20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Walking Lunges: 3 sets of 10 reps per leg, 60 sec rest\n    * Leg Extensions (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 45 sec rest\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (quads, hamstrings, calves) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n* **Note:** Maintain proper squat form – chest up, back straight.\n\n**Day 3: Active Recovery**\n* 30 minutes of low-intensity cardio (walking, swimming, cycling).

Introduce supersets (performing two exercises back-to-back with no rest). Reduce rest intervals to 45-60 seconds.  Introduce variations of exercises (e.g., incline dumbbell press to flat dumbbell press).\n* **Example (Day 1):** Incline DB Press (3x20), immediately followed by Push-ups (AMRAP) - rest 60 seconds. Repeat 3 times.\n\n**Weeks 5-7: Introducing Weight & Tempo**\n* **Key Changes:** Gradually increase weight used, maintaining proper form. Introduce tempo training – slowing down the eccentric (lowering) phase of the exercise (e.g., 3-1-1 tempo: 3 seconds down, 1 second pause, 1 second up).\n* **Example (Day 2):** Squats (3x15) with a 3-1-1 tempo.\n\n**Weeks 8-10:  Peak Endurance & Active Recovery Refinement**\n* **Key Changes:**  Focus on circuit training – performing a series of exercises with minimal rest between them.

Focus on mindfulness during recovery.\n* **Example (Day 5):** Circuit: Plank (30 sec), Russian Twists (20 reps), Bird Dog (10/side), Glute Bridges (15 reps) – repeat 3-4 times with 60 seconds rest between circuits.\n\n\n\n**Sample Weekly Split (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Monday:** Upper Body - Push (Supersets, Tempo)\n* **Tuesday:** Lower Body - Quad Focus (Weight Increase, Tempo)\n* **Wednesday:** Active Recovery (45 min Cardio, Foam Rolling)\n* **Thursday:** Upper Body - Pull (Supersets, Weight Increase)\n* **Friday:** Full Body Circuit Training (Plyometrics – *if* appropriate)\n* **Saturday:** Rest or Light Activity (Yoga, Walking)\n* **Sunday:** Rest\n\n\n\n**Final Notes from Anna Smirnova:**\n\nThis program is a journey, not a race.  There will be days when you feel fantastic, and days when you struggle.  That’s okay.  The key is consistency and listening to your body.  Don’t be afraid to modify exercises or take extra rest days when needed.  Remember why you started – whether it’s to rebuild strength, improve endurance, or simply feel better in your own skin.  Embrace the process, celebrate your progress, and believe in your ability to achieve your goals.  I’m here to support you on your journey.  Don't hesitate to seek professional guidance if you have any concerns.  You’ve got this!  Stay hydrated, fuel your body, and keep moving forward.

Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.

I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!

YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.

Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.

Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Supplements (Optional):**  Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid muscle growth and performance.  Whey protein can help meet protein goals. *Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:**  Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night.  Active recovery (light cardio, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form Over Everything:** Watch videos of each exercise before attempting it.

This program is designed for beginners, focusing on building a solid foundation while maximizing muscle stimulation through High-Intensity Interval Training. Remember consistency is key! Listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and don't be afraid to modify exercises as needed.  We’ll focus on compound movements to get the most ‘bang for your buck’ and stimulate multiple muscle groups simultaneously.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, and increase intake on workout days.  Consider an electrolyte drink post-workout, especially if you sweat heavily.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires adequate protein intake. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.  Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Supplements (Optional):**  Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid muscle growth and performance.  Whey protein can help meet protein goals. *Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:**  Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night.

This program is designed for beginners, focusing on building a solid foundation while maximizing muscle stimulation through High-Intensity Interval Training. Remember consistency is key! Listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and don't be afraid to modify exercises as needed.  We’ll focus on compound movements to get the most ‘bang for your buck’ and stimulate multiple muscle groups simultaneously.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, and increase intake on workout days.  Consider an electrolyte drink post-workout, especially if you sweat heavily.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires adequate protein intake. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.  Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Supplements (Optional):**  Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid muscle growth and performance.  Whey protein can help meet protein goals. *Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:**  Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night.  Active recovery (light cardio, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form Over Everything:** Watch videos of each exercise before attempting it. Focus on controlled movements and proper technique.  If you're unsure, start with bodyweight only.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Building the Foundation (3 workouts/week)**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body HIIT**\n* **Warm-up (5 mins):** Jumping jacks (30 secs), High knees (30 secs), Butt kicks (30 secs), Arm circles (forward & backward - 30 secs each), Dynamic stretches (leg swings, torso twists - 1 min)\n* **Workout (25 mins):**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (60 secs rest)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (60 secs rest)\n    * Walking Lunges: 3 sets of 10 reps per leg (60 secs rest)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-45 secs (60 secs rest)\n    * Burpees (modified - step back instead of jump): 3 sets of 8-10 reps (60 secs rest)\n* **Cool-down (5 mins):** Static stretches (hold each stretch for 30 secs) - Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch.\n* **Notes:** Focus on mastering the form of each exercise.

I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.

Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","85    {'Activity Type': 'Bodybuilding', 'Program Goa...

Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable.

YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable.

This program is designed for beginners with little to no prior weightlifting experience. We'll focus on proper form, progressive overload, and consistent stretching to achieve both muscle growth and increased range of motion.\n\n**Trainer:** Maria Kuznetsova, NASM Certified Personal Trainer (Basic)\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when you need to. Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.  YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","75    {'Activity Type': 'Bodybuilding', 'Program Goa...

It focuses on a split routine, targeting different muscle groups on different days to allow for adequate recovery.  We'll combine strength training with principles of progressive overload to build muscle while maintaining a caloric deficit for weight loss.  Consistency, proper form, and adequate nutrition are key to success.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Nutrition:** This program *requires* a calorie-controlled diet with sufficient protein (around 1 gram per pound of body weight). Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water daily, especially before, during, and after workouts.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (5g/day) can aid in muscle recovery and performance. Whey protein can help meet protein needs. Consult your doctor before starting any new supplement.\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Active recovery (light cardio, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form over Weight:**  Always prioritize proper form to prevent injuries.

This program is designed for beginners with little to no prior weightlifting experience. We'll focus on proper form, progressive overload, and consistent stretching to achieve both muscle growth and increased range of motion.\n\n**Trainer:** Maria Kuznetsova, NASM Certified Personal Trainer (Basic)\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when you need to. Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.  YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","61    {'Activity Type': 'HIIT', 'Program Goal': ['Mu...

Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.

I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.

Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable.

Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","85    {'Activity Type': 'Bodybuilding', 'Program Goa...

It prioritizes compound movements for maximum efficiency and incorporates periodization to prevent plateaus and optimize results.  We\'ll start with foundational strength and build towards more challenging variations.  Listen to your body, prioritize form, and remember consistency is key.  This program is designed for 1-2 workouts per week, allowing for adequate recovery.  If you feel exceptionally sore, take an extra rest day.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires a caloric surplus. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods. Consider a creatine supplement (3-5g daily) for enhanced strength and muscle growth (consult with a healthcare professional first).\n* **Warm-up:**  5-10 minutes of light cardio (jumping jacks, high knees, arm circles) and dynamic stretching (leg swings, torso twists, shoulder rotations) before each workout.\n* **Cool-down:** 5-10 minutes of static stretching (holding each stretch for 30 seconds) after each workout. Focus on the muscles worked.\n* **Progression:**  Each week, aim to increase the weight lifted (even slightly), the number of reps, or the number of sets. If you can comfortably complete all sets and reps with good form, it\'s time to increase the challenge.\n* **Form over Ego:**  Prioritize proper form above lifting heavy weight.  Incorrect form can lead to injury. Watch videos and, if possible, work with a qualified trainer to ensure you are performing exercises correctly.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Familiarization (Focus: Learning Form)**\n\n* **Day 1 (Monday): Full Body**\n    * Warm-up\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 8-12 reps per arm (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Overhead Press (Dumbbells): 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest 30 seconds)\n    * Cool-down\n    * *Note:* Focus on controlled movements.

This program is designed for beginners with little to no prior weightlifting experience. We'll focus on proper form, progressive overload, and consistent stretching to achieve both muscle growth and increased range of motion.\n\n**Trainer:** Maria Kuznetsova, NASM Certified Personal Trainer (Basic)\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when you need to. Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.  YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","39    {'Activity Type': 'Strength Training', 'Progra...

This program is designed for beginners with little to no prior weightlifting experience. We'll focus on proper form, progressive overload, and consistent stretching to achieve both muscle growth and increased range of motion.\n\n**Trainer:** Maria Kuznetsova, NASM Certified Personal Trainer (Basic)\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when you need to. Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.  YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","45    {'Activity Type': 'Strength Training', 'Progra...

This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","66    {'Activity Type': 'CrossFit', 'Program Goal': ...

It prioritizes compound movements for maximum efficiency and incorporates periodization to prevent plateaus and optimize results.  We\'ll start with foundational strength and build towards more challenging variations.  Listen to your body, prioritize form, and remember consistency is key.  This program is designed for 1-2 workouts per week, allowing for adequate recovery.  If you feel exceptionally sore, take an extra rest day.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires a caloric surplus. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods. Consider a creatine supplement (3-5g daily) for enhanced strength and muscle growth (consult with a healthcare professional first).\n* **Warm-up:**  5-10 minutes of light cardio (jumping jacks, high knees, arm circles) and dynamic stretching (leg swings, torso twists, shoulder rotations) before each workout.\n* **Cool-down:** 5-10 minutes of static stretching (holding each stretch for 30 seconds) after each workout. Focus on the muscles worked.\n* **Progression:**  Each week, aim to increase the weight lifted (even slightly), the number of reps, or the number of sets. If you can comfortably complete all sets and reps with good form, it\'s time to increase the challenge.\n* **Form over Ego:**  Prioritize proper form above lifting heavy weight.  Incorrect form can lead to injury. Watch videos and, if possible, work with a qualified trainer to ensure you are performing exercises correctly.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Familiarization (Focus: Learning Form)**\n\n* **Day 1 (Monday): Full Body**\n    * Warm-up\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 8-12 reps per arm (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Overhead Press (Dumbbells): 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest 30 seconds)\n    * Cool-down\n    * *Note:* Focus on controlled movements.

It focuses on full-body strength training with an emphasis on proper form and progressive overload. Remember, consistency is key! Listen to your body, and don't hesitate to modify exercises if needed. I, Maria Kuznetsova, am here to guide you on this journey.\n\n**Important Notes Before You Begin:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, and increase intake on workout days. Consider adding electrolytes if you sweat heavily.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. This program doesn’t include a detailed diet plan, but prioritize whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** A daily multivitamin can be beneficial.  Consider a protein supplement if you struggle to meet your protein needs through diet alone. *Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:**  Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Active recovery (light walking, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form Over Everything:** Watch videos of each exercise to ensure proper form. If you’re unsure, consider working with a qualified fitness professional for a session or two.\n* **Progressive Overload:**  As exercises become easier, gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets. This is crucial for continued progress.\n* **Listen to Your Body:**  Rest when you need to. Don't push through pain.  Modify exercises if necessary.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Building the Foundation**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body Introduction (Monday)**\n\n* **Warm-up (5 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP), 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Rows (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps per side, 60 sec rest\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30 seconds, 60 sec rest\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n* **Cool-down (5 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds - quads, hamstrings, chest, triceps).\n* **Notes:** Focus on form.

It prioritizes controlled movements, high reps, and active recovery.  The duration is kept to 30 minutes or less to minimize stress on the body while maximizing effectiveness.  Listen to your body, and *always* prioritize form over weight.  This is about rebuilding and becoming stronger, not ego lifting.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Medical Clearance:** *Crucially*, this program assumes you have been cleared by a doctor or physical therapist to engage in bodybuilding and endurance-focused exercises, especially considering the rehabilitation aspect.\n* **Nutrition:**  This program is *most* effective when paired with a diet rich in protein (1.6-2.2g/kg bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.  Hydration is paramount – aim for at least 3 liters of water daily. Consider supplementing with creatine monohydrate (3-5g/day) for enhanced endurance and recovery, and a multivitamin. Consult with a registered dietitian for personalized nutrition guidance.\n* **Form:** Watch videos of each exercise to ensure proper form. Incorrect form can negate benefits and increase injury risk.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase weight, reps, or sets each week, *only* if your form remains impeccable.\n* **Rest & Recovery:**  Adequate sleep (7-9 hours) is non-negotiable.  Active recovery days are vital.  Don't skip them!\n* **Listen to Your Body:**  If you experience pain, STOP. Modify the exercise or consult with a professional.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Activation (Focus: Re-establishing Neuromuscular Connection)**\n\n* **Frequency:** 5 days/week\n* **Intensity:** Low-Moderate\n\n**Day 1: Upper Body - Push**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio (light jogging/jumping jacks), dynamic stretching (arm circles, shoulder rotations).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Incline Dumbbell Press: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Push-ups (modified on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP), 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Shoulder Press: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Triceps Pushdowns (cable or band): 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (chest, shoulders, triceps) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements. Hydrate well.\n\n**Day 2: Lower Body - Quad Focus**\n* **Warm-up:** 5 min cardio (light cycling), dynamic stretching (leg swings, hip circles).\n* **Exercises:**\n    * Bodyweight Squats: 3 sets of 20 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Walking Lunges: 3 sets of 10 reps per leg, 60 sec rest\n    * Leg Extensions (light weight): 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 45 sec rest\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 20 reps, 45 sec rest\n* **Cool-down:** Static stretching (quads, hamstrings, calves) – hold each stretch for 30 seconds.\n* **Note:** Maintain proper squat form – chest up, back straight.\n\n**Day 3: Active Recovery**\n* 30 minutes of low-intensity cardio (walking, swimming, cycling).

Each week will follow a similar structure to Week 1, but with progressive adjustments. I will outline key changes for each week, rather than repeating the full daily schedule.)*\n\n**Weeks 2-4: Increasing Volume**\n* **Key Changes:** Increase reps by 2-5 per set.  Introduce supersets (performing two exercises back-to-back with no rest). Reduce rest intervals to 45-60 seconds.  Introduce variations of exercises (e.g., incline dumbbell press to flat dumbbell press).\n* **Example (Day 1):** Incline DB Press (3x20), immediately followed by Push-ups (AMRAP) - rest 60 seconds. Repeat 3 times.\n\n**Weeks 5-7: Introducing Weight & Tempo**\n* **Key Changes:** Gradually increase weight used, maintaining proper form. Introduce tempo training – slowing down the eccentric (lowering) phase of the exercise (e.g., 3-1-1 tempo: 3 seconds down, 1 second pause, 1 second up).\n* **Example (Day 2):** Squats (3x15) with a 3-1-1 tempo.\n\n**Weeks 8-10:  Peak Endurance & Active Recovery Refinement**\n* **Key Changes:**  Focus on circuit training – performing a series of exercises with minimal rest between them. Increase cardio duration on active recovery days. Introduce plyometric exercises (jump squats, box jumps – *if* appropriate for rehabilitation).  Focus on mindfulness during recovery.\n* **Example (Day 5):** Circuit: Plank (30 sec), Russian Twists (20 reps), Bird Dog (10/side), Glute Bridges (15 reps) – repeat 3-4 times with 60 seconds rest between circuits.\n\n\n\n**Sample Weekly Split (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Monday:** Upper Body - Push (Supersets, Tempo)\n* **Tuesday:** Lower Body - Quad Focus (Weight Increase, Tempo)\n* **Wednesday:** Active Recovery (45 min Cardio, Foam Rolling)\n* **Thursday:** Upper Body - Pull (Supersets, Weight Increase)\n* **Friday:** Full Body Circuit Training (Plyometrics – *if* appropriate)\n* **Saturday:** Rest or Light Activity (Yoga, Walking)\n* **Sunday:** Rest\n\n\n\n**Final Notes from Anna Smirnova:**\n\nThis program is a journey, not a race.  There will be days when you feel fantastic, and days when you struggle.  That’s okay.  The key is consistency and listening to your body.  Don’t be afraid to modify exercises or take extra rest days when needed.  Remember why you started – whether it’s to rebuild strength, improve endurance, or simply feel better in your own skin.  Embrace the process, celebrate your progress, and believe in your ability to achieve your goals.  I’m here to support you on your journey.  Don't hesitate to seek professional guidance if you have any concerns.  You’ve got this!  Stay hydrated, fuel your body, and keep moving forward.  The Phoenix *will* rise.""}","81    {'Activity Type': 'Bodybuilding', 'Program Goa...

It focuses on a split routine, targeting different muscle groups on different days to allow for adequate recovery.  We'll combine strength training with principles of progressive overload to build muscle while maintaining a caloric deficit for weight loss.  Consistency, proper form, and adequate nutrition are key to success.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Nutrition:** This program *requires* a calorie-controlled diet with sufficient protein (around 1 gram per pound of body weight). Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water daily, especially before, during, and after workouts.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (5g/day) can aid in muscle recovery and performance. Whey protein can help meet protein needs. Consult your doctor before starting any new supplement.\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night.

It focuses on a split routine, targeting different muscle groups on different days to allow for adequate recovery.  We'll combine strength training with principles of progressive overload to build muscle while maintaining a caloric deficit for weight loss.  Consistency, proper form, and adequate nutrition are key to success.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Nutrition:** This program *requires* a calorie-controlled diet with sufficient protein (around 1 gram per pound of body weight). Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water daily, especially before, during, and after workouts.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (5g/day) can aid in muscle recovery and performance. Whey protein can help meet protein needs. Consult your doctor before starting any new supplement.\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Active recovery (light cardio, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form over Weight:**  Always prioritize proper form to prevent injuries. Start with a weight you can comfortably lift with good technique.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week to challenge your muscles.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Form Focus**\n\n**Day 1: Upper Body - Chest & Triceps** (Monday)\n\n* **Warm-up (5 mins):** Dynamic stretching - arm circles, shoulder rotations, torso twists.

Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.  YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","70    {'Activity Type': 'CrossFit', 'Program Goal': ...

This program is designed for beginners with little to no prior weightlifting experience. We'll focus on proper form, progressive overload, and consistent stretching to achieve both muscle growth and increased range of motion.\n\n**Trainer:** Maria Kuznetsova, NASM Certified Personal Trainer (Basic)\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when you need to. Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.  YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","3    {'Activity Type': 'HIIT', 'Program Goal': ['Mu...

I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.

Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!

Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency.

Whey protein can help meet protein needs. Consult your doctor before starting any new supplement.\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Active recovery (light cardio, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form over Weight:**  Always prioritize proper form to prevent injuries.

It focuses on a split routine, targeting different muscle groups on different days to allow for adequate recovery.  We'll combine strength training with principles of progressive overload to build muscle while maintaining a caloric deficit for weight loss.  Consistency, proper form, and adequate nutrition are key to success.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Nutrition:** This program *requires* a calorie-controlled diet with sufficient protein (around 1 gram per pound of body weight). Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water daily, especially before, during, and after workouts.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (5g/day) can aid in muscle recovery and performance. Whey protein can help meet protein needs. Consult your doctor before starting any new supplement.\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Active recovery (light cardio, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form over Weight:**  Always prioritize proper form to prevent injuries. Start with a weight you can comfortably lift with good technique.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week to challenge your muscles.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Form Focus**\n\n**Day 1: Upper Body - Chest & Triceps** (Monday)\n\n* **Warm-up (5 mins):** Dynamic stretching - arm circles, shoulder rotations, torso twists.

We’ll blend traditional CrossFit movements with targeted stretching and mobility work.  The focus isn\'t on max effort strength, but on controlled movements and increasing range of motion.  Consistency is key. Listen to your body, modify exercises as needed, and prioritize proper form over speed or weight. Remember, flexibility is a journey, not a destination.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially before, during, and after workouts. Consider adding electrolytes if you sweat heavily.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.  A post-workout protein shake (20-30g) can aid recovery.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Magnesium glycinate can aid muscle recovery and relaxation. Omega-3 fatty acids can reduce inflammation. Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night.  Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged. Foam rolling and self-massage are excellent tools for muscle recovery.\n* **Scaling:** If an exercise feels too difficult, scale it down. Reduce weight, reps, or range of motion.  Never sacrifice form.\n* **Warm-up & Cool-down:** *Never* skip these! They are crucial for injury prevention and recovery.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Assessment**\n\n**Day 1: Mobility & Core Activation (25 mins)**\n\n* **Warm-up (5 mins):**  Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) 2 mins.

It prioritizes compound movements for maximum efficiency and incorporates periodization to prevent plateaus and optimize results.  We\'ll start with foundational strength and build towards more challenging variations.  Listen to your body, prioritize form, and remember consistency is key.  This program is designed for 1-2 workouts per week, allowing for adequate recovery.  If you feel exceptionally sore, take an extra rest day.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires a caloric surplus. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods. Consider a creatine supplement (3-5g daily) for enhanced strength and muscle growth (consult with a healthcare professional first).\n* **Warm-up:**  5-10 minutes of light cardio (jumping jacks, high knees, arm circles) and dynamic stretching (leg swings, torso twists, shoulder rotations) before each workout.\n* **Cool-down:** 5-10 minutes of static stretching (holding each stretch for 30 seconds) after each workout. Focus on the muscles worked.\n* **Progression:**  Each week, aim to increase the weight lifted (even slightly), the number of reps, or the number of sets. If you can comfortably complete all sets and reps with good form, it\'s time to increase the challenge.\n* **Form over Ego:**  Prioritize proper form above lifting heavy weight.  Incorrect form can lead to injury. Watch videos and, if possible, work with a qualified trainer to ensure you are performing exercises correctly.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Familiarization (Focus: Learning Form)**\n\n* **Day 1 (Monday): Full Body**\n    * Warm-up\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 8-12 reps per arm (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Overhead Press (Dumbbells): 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest 30 seconds)\n    * Cool-down\n    * *Note:* Focus on controlled movements.

It focuses on full-body strength training with an emphasis on proper form and progressive overload. Remember, consistency is key! Listen to your body, and don't hesitate to modify exercises if needed. I, Maria Kuznetsova, am here to guide you on this journey.\n\n**Important Notes Before You Begin:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, and increase intake on workout days. Consider adding electrolytes if you sweat heavily.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. This program doesn’t include a detailed diet plan, but prioritize whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** A daily multivitamin can be beneficial.  Consider a protein supplement if you struggle to meet your protein needs through diet alone. *Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:**  Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Active recovery (light walking, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form Over Everything:** Watch videos of each exercise to ensure proper form. If you’re unsure, consider working with a qualified fitness professional for a session or two.\n* **Progressive Overload:**  As exercises become easier, gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets. This is crucial for continued progress.\n* **Listen to Your Body:**  Rest when you need to. Don't push through pain.  Modify exercises if necessary.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Building the Foundation**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body Introduction (Monday)**\n\n* **Warm-up (5 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP), 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Rows (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps per side, 60 sec rest\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30 seconds, 60 sec rest\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n* **Cool-down (5 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds - quads, hamstrings, chest, triceps).\n* **Notes:** Focus on form.

It focuses on full-body strength training with an emphasis on proper form and progressive overload. Remember, consistency is key! Listen to your body, and don't hesitate to modify exercises if needed. I, Maria Kuznetsova, am here to guide you on this journey.\n\n**Important Notes Before You Begin:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, and increase intake on workout days.

This program doesn’t include a detailed diet plan, but prioritize whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** A daily multivitamin can be beneficial.

Active recovery (light walking, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form Over Everything:** Watch videos of each exercise to ensure proper form. If you’re unsure, consider working with a qualified fitness professional for a session or two.\n* **Progressive Overload:**  As exercises become easier, gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets.

It focuses on a split routine, targeting different muscle groups on different days to allow for adequate recovery.  We'll combine strength training with principles of progressive overload to build muscle while maintaining a caloric deficit for weight loss.  Consistency, proper form, and adequate nutrition are key to success.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Nutrition:** This program *requires* a calorie-controlled diet with sufficient protein (around 1 gram per pound of body weight). Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water daily, especially before, during, and after workouts.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (5g/day) can aid in muscle recovery and performance. Whey protein can help meet protein needs. Consult your doctor before starting any new supplement.\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Active recovery (light cardio, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form over Weight:**  Always prioritize proper form to prevent injuries. Start with a weight you can comfortably lift with good technique.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week to challenge your muscles.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Form Focus**\n\n**Day 1: Upper Body - Chest & Triceps** (Monday)\n\n* **Warm-up (5 mins):** Dynamic stretching - arm circles, shoulder rotations, torso twists.

We’ll blend traditional CrossFit movements with targeted stretching and mobility work.  The focus isn\'t on max effort strength, but on controlled movements and increasing range of motion.  Consistency is key. Listen to your body, modify exercises as needed, and prioritize proper form over speed or weight. Remember, flexibility is a journey, not a destination.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially before, during, and after workouts. Consider adding electrolytes if you sweat heavily.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.  A post-workout protein shake (20-30g) can aid recovery.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Magnesium glycinate can aid muscle recovery and relaxation. Omega-3 fatty acids can reduce inflammation. Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night.  Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged. Foam rolling and self-massage are excellent tools for muscle recovery.\n* **Scaling:** If an exercise feels too difficult, scale it down. Reduce weight, reps, or range of motion.  Never sacrifice form.\n* **Warm-up & Cool-down:** *Never* skip these!

I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.

YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","110    {'Activity Type': 'Strength Training', 'Progra...

Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.  YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","7    {'Activity Type': 'CrossFit', 'Program Goal': ...

YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","104    {'Activity Type': 'Strength Training', 'Progra...

It focuses on full-body strength training with an emphasis on proper form and progressive overload. Remember, consistency is key! Listen to your body, and don't hesitate to modify exercises if needed. I, Maria Kuznetsova, am here to guide you on this journey.\n\n**Important Notes Before You Begin:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, and increase intake on workout days. Consider adding electrolytes if you sweat heavily.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. This program doesn’t include a detailed diet plan, but prioritize whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** A daily multivitamin can be beneficial.  Consider a protein supplement if you struggle to meet your protein needs through diet alone. *Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:**  Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Active recovery (light walking, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form Over Everything:** Watch videos of each exercise to ensure proper form. If you’re unsure, consider working with a qualified fitness professional for a session or two.\n* **Progressive Overload:**  As exercises become easier, gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets. This is crucial for continued progress.\n* **Listen to Your Body:**  Rest when you need to. Don't push through pain.

Listen to your body, and don't hesitate to modify exercises if needed.

Active recovery (light walking, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form Over Everything:** Watch videos of each exercise to ensure proper form.

It focuses on full-body strength training with an emphasis on proper form and progressive overload. Remember, consistency is key! Listen to your body, and don't hesitate to modify exercises if needed. I, Maria Kuznetsova, am here to guide you on this journey.\n\n**Important Notes Before You Begin:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, and increase intake on workout days. Consider adding electrolytes if you sweat heavily.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. This program doesn’t include a detailed diet plan, but prioritize whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** A daily multivitamin can be beneficial.  Consider a protein supplement if you struggle to meet your protein needs through diet alone. *Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:**  Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Active recovery (light walking, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form Over Everything:** Watch videos of each exercise to ensure proper form. If you’re unsure, consider working with a qualified fitness professional for a session or two.\n* **Progressive Overload:**  As exercises become easier, gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets. This is crucial for continued progress.\n* **Listen to Your Body:**  Rest when you need to. Don't push through pain.  Modify exercises if necessary.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Building the Foundation**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body Introduction (Monday)**\n\n* **Warm-up (5 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps, 60 sec rest\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP), 60 sec rest\n    * Dumbbell Rows (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps per side, 60 sec rest\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30 seconds, 60 sec rest\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 60 sec rest\n* **Cool-down (5 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds - quads, hamstrings, chest, triceps).\n* **Notes:** Focus on form.

It prioritizes compound movements for maximum efficiency and incorporates periodization to prevent plateaus and optimize results.  We\'ll start with foundational strength and build towards more challenging variations.  Listen to your body, prioritize form, and remember consistency is key.  This program is designed for 1-2 workouts per week, allowing for adequate recovery.  If you feel exceptionally sore, take an extra rest day.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires a caloric surplus. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods. Consider a creatine supplement (3-5g daily) for enhanced strength and muscle growth (consult with a healthcare professional first).\n* **Warm-up:**  5-10 minutes of light cardio (jumping jacks, high knees, arm circles) and dynamic stretching (leg swings, torso twists, shoulder rotations) before each workout.\n* **Cool-down:** 5-10 minutes of static stretching (holding each stretch for 30 seconds) after each workout. Focus on the muscles worked.\n* **Progression:**  Each week, aim to increase the weight lifted (even slightly), the number of reps, or the number of sets. If you can comfortably complete all sets and reps with good form, it\'s time to increase the challenge.\n* **Form over Ego:**  Prioritize proper form above lifting heavy weight.  Incorrect form can lead to injury. Watch videos and, if possible, work with a qualified trainer to ensure you are performing exercises correctly.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Familiarization (Focus: Learning Form)**\n\n* **Day 1 (Monday): Full Body**\n    * Warm-up\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 8-12 reps per arm (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Overhead Press (Dumbbells): 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest 30 seconds)\n    * Cool-down\n    * *Note:* Focus on controlled movements.

It prioritizes compound movements for maximum efficiency and incorporates periodization to prevent plateaus and optimize results.  We\'ll start with foundational strength and build towards more challenging variations.  Listen to your body, prioritize form, and remember consistency is key.  This program is designed for 1-2 workouts per week, allowing for adequate recovery.  If you feel exceptionally sore, take an extra rest day.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires a caloric surplus. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods. Consider a creatine supplement (3-5g daily) for enhanced strength and muscle growth (consult with a healthcare professional first).\n* **Warm-up:**  5-10 minutes of light cardio (jumping jacks, high knees, arm circles) and dynamic stretching (leg swings, torso twists, shoulder rotations) before each workout.\n* **Cool-down:** 5-10 minutes of static stretching (holding each stretch for 30 seconds) after each workout. Focus on the muscles worked.\n* **Progression:**  Each week, aim to increase the weight lifted (even slightly), the number of reps, or the number of sets. If you can comfortably complete all sets and reps with good form, it\'s time to increase the challenge.\n* **Form over Ego:**  Prioritize proper form above lifting heavy weight.

This program is designed for beginners, focusing on building a solid foundation while maximizing muscle stimulation through High-Intensity Interval Training. Remember consistency is key!

This program is designed for beginners, focusing on building a solid foundation while maximizing muscle stimulation through High-Intensity Interval Training. Remember consistency is key!

It\'s adaptive, meaning exercises can be modified based on individual pain levels and progress. *Always listen to your body and consult with your physician before starting any new exercise program.* The focus is on rebuilding strength, improving range of motion, and restoring functional movement. We will prioritize proper form over heavy weight. This program assumes a ""basic"" level of mobility, meaning you can perform fundamental movements without acute pain. Adjustments are noted throughout for lower starting points.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, and increase intake on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per lb of bodyweight) to support muscle recovery.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Consider a daily multivitamin and potentially creatine monohydrate (3-5g/day) after consulting your doctor.\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Active recovery (light walking, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Pain Management:** If you experience sharp or increasing pain, STOP the exercise immediately and consult with a healthcare professional. Modify the exercise to a pain-free range of motion.\n* **Progression:**  Increase weight, reps, or sets *only* when you can perform the current workload with good form and without pain.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility (Focus: Re-establishing Movement Patterns)**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body - Gentle Activation** (60 mins)\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles (forward & backward - 20 reps each), Leg swings (forward & sideways - 10 reps each leg), Torso twists (15 reps), Cat-Cow stretch (10 reps).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Bodyweight Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60s) – *Modification: Squat to a chair if needed.*\n    * Wall Push-ups: 3 sets of 8-10 reps (Rest: 60s) – *Modification: Increase distance from the wall for easier execution.*\n    * Bird Dog: 3 sets of 10 reps per side (Rest: 45s) – *Focus on core stability.*\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60s)\n    * Band Pull-Aparts: 3 sets of 15 reps (Rest: 45s) – *Use a light resistance band.*\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretches – Hamstring stretch (30s each leg), Quadriceps stretch (30s each leg), Triceps stretch (30s each arm), Child’s Pose (60s).\n\n**Day 2: Upper Body - Light Resistance** (45 mins)\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Shoulder rotations, wrist circles, elbow bends, light cardio (marching in place).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (2-5lbs) (Rest: 60s)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (2-5lbs) (Rest: 60s)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 8-10 reps per side (2-5lbs) (Rest: 60s)\n    * Shoulder Raises (Front & Lateral): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (1-3lbs) (Rest: 60s)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Shoulder stretches, triceps stretch, bicep stretch.\n\n**Day 3: Lower Body - Stability & Strength** (45 mins)\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Hip circles, ankle rotations, calf raises, light marching.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Bodyweight Lunges: 3 sets of 8-10 reps per leg (Rest: 60s) – *Modification: Shorten the lunge step.*\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45s)\n    * Hamstring Curls (with resistance band): 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60s)\n    * Single Leg Balance: 3 sets of 30 seconds per leg (Rest: 30s)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Hamstring stretch, quadriceps stretch, calf stretch.\n\n**Day 4: Active Recovery** – 30 mins of light walking and gentle stretching.\n\n**Day 5: Core & Flexibility** (45 mins)\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Cat-Cow, gentle torso twists, pelvic tilts.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60s) – *Modification: Plank on knees.*\n    * Crunches: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45s)\n    * Russian Twists (no weight): 3 sets of 15 reps per side (Rest: 45s)\n    * Yoga Flow (Sun Salutations – modified): 3 rounds (Rest: 60s between rounds)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Deep breathing exercises, spinal twists, child’s pose.\n\n---\n\n**Week 2: Building Endurance & Control (Focus: Increasing Reps & Time Under Tension)**\n\n*Increase reps by 2-3 per set from Week 1.

Don’t push through pain. Modify exercises if necessary.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight), complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Consider a basic multivitamin.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (3-5g daily) can aid in muscle recovery and growth. Protein powder can help meet daily protein goals. *Consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.*\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Active recovery (light cardio, walking) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n* **Form Over Weight:** ALWAYS prioritize proper form over lifting heavy weight.  Watch videos, use a mirror, and consider recording yourself to ensure correct technique.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Mobility**\n\n**Day 1: Full Body – Strength & Static Stretching**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) + dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings, torso twists).\n* **Workout:**\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per arm (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Overhead Press (light dumbbells): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest: 60 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching (hold each stretch for 30 seconds): Hamstring stretch, Quadriceps stretch, Triceps stretch, Shoulder stretch, Chest stretch.\n* **Note:** Focus on controlled movements and proper form.\n\n**Day 2: Active Recovery & Yoga**\n* 30-45 minutes of beginner-level yoga focusing on flexibility and balance.  YouTube is a great resource for guided yoga sessions.\n* **Hydration:** Focus on electrolytes after yoga.\n\n**Day 3: Upper Body – Strength & Mobility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Arm circles, shoulder rotations, wrist stretches.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Dumbbell Triceps Extensions: 3 sets of 12-15 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Lateral Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Face Pulls: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on chest, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.\n\n**Day 4: Rest**\n\n**Day 5: Lower Body – Strength & Flexibility**\n* **Warm-up (10 mins):** Leg swings, hip circles, ankle rotations.\n* **Workout:**\n    * Lunges: 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Romanian Deadlifts (light weight): 3 sets of 10-12 reps (Rest: 60 secs)\n    * Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n    * Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 15-20 reps (Rest: 45 secs)\n* **Cool-down (10 mins):** Static stretching – focus on hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.\n\n**Day 6:  Light Cardio & Foam Rolling**\n* 30 minutes of brisk walking or cycling.\n* 15 minutes of foam rolling targeting major muscle groups.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Weeks 2-10: Progressive Overload & Increased Complexity**\n\n*(The following weeks will build upon Week 1, progressively increasing weight, reps, sets, or introducing new exercises. I will provide a summary for each week, highlighting key changes. Detailed daily workouts would be excessively long.  Focus will be on increasing weight by 2.5-5lbs when possible, and adding reps/sets when weight increases are not feasible.)*\n\n**Week 2:** Increase weight slightly on strength exercises. Introduce bird-dogs for core stability.  Increase static stretch hold times to 45 seconds.\n\n**Week 3:** Introduce incline dumbbell press.  Add a superset (two exercises back-to-back with no rest) to one upper body day (e.g., Bicep Curls superset with Triceps Extensions).\n\n**Week 4:**  Increase weight again.  Introduce single-leg Romanian Deadlifts to challenge balance and stability. Focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) phase of each lift.\n\n**Week 5:** Introduce dumbbell shoulder press variations (Arnold Press).  Add a plyometric element to lower body day (e.g., jump squats – 3 sets of 8-10 reps).\n\n**Week 6:** Deload week - reduce weight by 20-30% to allow for recovery. Focus on form and flexibility.  Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to continue.\n* **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** If you're unsure about proper form or need help with the program, don't hesitate to ask a qualified fitness professional.\n* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.  This will help you stay motivated and positive.\n* **Enjoy the Process!** Fitness should be enjoyable. Find activities that you like and make them a part of your lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThis program is a starting point.  It's designed to be adaptable to your individual needs and preferences.  Remember to listen to your body, prioritize proper form, and stay consistent.  Good luck on your fitness journey!""}","10    {'Activity Type': 'Strength Training', 'Progra...

Increase yoga sessions to twice this week.\n\n**Week 7:**  Introduce pull-up negatives (assisted if needed). Increase weight on all exercises where possible.  Add a core circuit (crunches, Russian twists, leg raises).\n\n**Week 8:** Introduce walking lunges. Add a drop set to one exercise per workout (perform a set to failure, then reduce weight and continue for more reps).\n\n**Week 9:** Introduce cable rows.  Increase the intensity of plyometric exercises. Focus on mind-muscle connection during each lift.\n\n**Week 10:**  Test week – re-assess your strength and flexibility.  Continue with the program, maintaining the increased weight and intensity.  Plan for future goals!  Consider adding more advanced exercises or a new program focus.\n\n**Sample Daily Structure (Weeks 2-10):**\n\n* **Warm-up (10-15 mins):** Dynamic stretching and light cardio.\n* **Strength Training (45-60 mins):**  Focus on compound exercises first, then isolation exercises.\n* **Flexibility Training (15-20 mins):** Static stretching, foam rolling, or yoga.\n* **Cool-down (5-10 mins):** Light cardio and deep breathing.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Advice from Maria Kuznetsova:**\n\n* **Consistency is Key:**  The most important factor in achieving your goals is consistency. Stick to the program as much as possible, even when you don't feel motivated.\n* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a workout journal to track your weight, reps, and sets.

It prioritizes compound movements for maximum efficiency and incorporates periodization to prevent plateaus and optimize results.  We\'ll start with foundational strength and build towards more challenging variations.  Listen to your body, prioritize form, and remember consistency is key.  This program is designed for 1-2 workouts per week, allowing for adequate recovery.  If you feel exceptionally sore, take an extra rest day.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 3 liters of water daily, especially on workout days.\n* **Nutrition:**  Muscle gain requires a caloric surplus. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods. Consider a creatine supplement (3-5g daily) for enhanced strength and muscle growth (consult with a healthcare professional first).\n* **Warm-up:**  5-10 minutes of light cardio (jumping jacks, high knees, arm circles) and dynamic stretching (leg swings, torso twists, shoulder rotations) before each workout.\n* **Cool-down:** 5-10 minutes of static stretching (holding each stretch for 30 seconds) after each workout. Focus on the muscles worked.\n* **Progression:**  Each week, aim to increase the weight lifted (even slightly), the number of reps, or the number of sets. If you can comfortably complete all sets and reps with good form, it\'s time to increase the challenge.\n* **Form over Ego:**  Prioritize proper form above lifting heavy weight.  Incorrect form can lead to injury. Watch videos and, if possible, work with a qualified trainer to ensure you are performing exercises correctly.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Familiarization (Focus: Learning Form)**\n\n* **Day 1 (Monday): Full Body**\n    * Warm-up\n    * Squats: 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Push-ups (on knees if needed): 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Dumbbell Rows: 3 sets of 8-12 reps per arm (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Overhead Press (Dumbbells): 3 sets of 8-12 reps (Rest 60 seconds)\n    * Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-60 seconds (Rest 30 seconds)\n    * Cool-down\n    * *Note:* Focus on controlled movements.

It focuses on a split routine, targeting different muscle groups on different days to allow for adequate recovery.  We'll combine strength training with principles of progressive overload to build muscle while maintaining a caloric deficit for weight loss.  Consistency, proper form, and adequate nutrition are key to success.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Nutrition:** This program *requires* a calorie-controlled diet with sufficient protein (around 1 gram per pound of body weight). Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.\n* **Hydration:** Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water daily, especially before, during, and after workouts.\n* **Supplements (Optional):** Creatine monohydrate (5g/day) can aid in muscle recovery and performance. Whey protein can help meet protein needs. Consult your doctor before starting any new supplement.\n* **Recovery:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Active recovery (light cardio, stretching) on rest days is encouraged.\n* **Form over Weight:**  Always prioritize proper form to prevent injuries. Start with a weight you can comfortably lift with good technique.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets each week to challenge your muscles.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Foundation & Form Focus**\n\n**Day 1: Upper Body - Chest & Triceps** (Monday)\n\n* **Warm-up (5 mins):** Dynamic stretching - arm circles, shoulder rotations, torso twists.
