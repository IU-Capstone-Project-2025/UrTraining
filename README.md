# UrTraining

A web-based platform for creating, distributing, and following personalized training plans. Users receive AI-assisted workout recommendations based on their fitness goals and conditions, while coaches can upload and manage their own structured training programs.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Idea

UrTraining helps clients avoid generic fitness advice and instead get structured programs tailored to their needs. At the same time, it enables trainers to easily share their expertise, grow their reach, and earn without having to learn tech or marketing.

Our AI-based system matches users with training programs created by verified coaches, making it easy to start and stay consistent with a personalized fitness journey.

## ðŸš€ Local Setup & Run Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/UrTraining.git
cd urtraining
```

### 2. Backend Setup (FastAPI)
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 3. Frontend Setup (React + Tailwind)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. ML Module (for recommendation engine)
```bash
cd ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Run any script or training notebook as needed
```

### 5. Environment Variables

Set environment variables for backend/frontend via .env files:


**backend/.env**

**frontend/.env**

**Hint:** copy ```.env.example``` to ```.env``` and fill in the required data before running the project.
