# UrTraining

A web-based platform for creating, distributing, and following personalized training plans. Users receive AI-assisted workout recommendations based on their fitness goals and conditions, while coaches can upload and manage their own structured training programs.

**Try it yourself:** [UrTraining](http://31.129.96.182/)

## ðŸ§  Project Idea

UrTraining helps clients avoid generic fitness advice and instead get structured programs tailored to their needs. At the same time, it enables trainers to easily share their expertise, grow their reach, and earn without having to learn tech or marketing.

Our AI-based system matches users with training programs created by verified coaches, making it easy to start and stay consistent with a personalized fitness journey.

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress

**Week 1:** Weâ€™ve completed foundational planning, divided responsibilities, and selected our tech stack. Interface design and early implementation of core features (questionnaire, catalog, recommendation engine) are underway.

**Week 2:** Transformed initial ideas into concrete requirements, established foundational designs, and set up project structures across the frontend and backend.

**Week 3:** Delivered the first working version of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This includes a fully functional end-to-end user journey, with integrated frontend and backend components, persistent data storage, and a basic authentication flow. Additionally, the ML team delivered the first model iteration, integrated via a backend API for early testing and validation.

**Week 4:** By the end of Week 4, we had a stable, tested, and deployed version of our application in a staging environment, complete with CI/CD automation. This allows for updates and reliable testing going forward. Additionally, the trainer user flow was successfully implemented.

**Week 5:** Gathering real user feedback, analyzing it, and iterating on our MVP to improve usability and stability. Usability testing sessions were conducted with external testers, allowing us to uncover both critical bugs and areas for UX enhancement.

**Week 6:** Our primary focus was on finalizing and polishing the project in preparation for the upcoming final presentation. We completed remaining high-priority features, fixed outstanding bugs, and performed comprehensive end-to-end testing to ensure stability and usability across the application. Also we conducted two more feedback sessions to see the user perpective.

**Week 7:** Final presentation.
