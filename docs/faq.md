I recommend creating **separate FAQ pages** for clients and coaches (if possible).

## FAQ — Client

### What is UrTraining and how does it work?
UrTraining is a web-based platform for creating, distributing, and following personalized training plans. Users receive AI-assisted workout recommendations based on their fitness goals and preferences. The workouts themselves are created by qualified trainers. At the same time, coaches can upload and manage their own structured training programs.

### Do I need to register to browse the courses?
Currently, registration is required to access full course details, but we are working on adding preview options without registration.

### How long does the personalization questionnaire take?
The questionnaire takes about 3–5 minutes and helps tailor your training plan to your specific needs.

### Is the platform free to use, or are there any paid features?
UrTraining is free to use. Pricing models for advanced features may be introduced later.

### How do I start a workout or course after registering?
After registering and completing the questionnaire, you’ll receive workout recommendations and can start a course directly from the catalog page. The started programs can be viewed in your profile.

### How do I switch between trainer and trainee roles?
Currently, the role is selected during registration and cannot be changed within the app. You can log out and create a new account with a different role. Role-switching functionality is planned for future updates.

### What are the terms I am agreeing to during registration?
By registering, you agree to our terms of service, including guidelines on content usage, data processing, and user conduct.

### How do I log out of my account?
There is a logout button in your profile.

### What kind of workouts are available on the platform?
Currently available types include:  
**Strength training, cardio, HIIT, yoga, pilates, functional training, CrossFit, bodybuilding, stretching, running, swimming, cycling, boxing, and dancing.**  
We are continuously expanding the list, so feel free to suggest new workout categories.

### How are personalized workouts generated?
After you complete the questionnaire, an AI system selects and adjusts workouts based on your goals, fitness level, preferences, and available equipment. The workouts themselves are generated by qualified trainers.

### Is there a Russian version of the platform?
Not yet, but localization is in progress — a Russian version is planned for a future release.

### Still have questions?
Feel free to [contact the developers](#).

## Placement Suggestions

I recommend replacing the current **About Us** block with **FAQ**, keeping a link to the Contact page there as well.  
Alternatively, we could keep both sections, but users may not intuitively expect answers to be under "About Us".

Another option is adding a **FAQ link directly on the homepage**. However, this may be less effective if users encounter questions while already navigating the platform — they’d need to return to the homepage and remember that’s where the FAQ link is.
